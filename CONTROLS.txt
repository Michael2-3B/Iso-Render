CONTROLS
--------
there's a lot, and they're fairly confusing right now, so bear with me.
I'll eventually change them to be more user friendly.


selection / block placement / block interaction
-----------------------------------------------

y=          = cycle block selection left
window      = cycle block selection right

up arrow    = move selection box north
down arrow  = move selection box south
left arrow  = move selection box west
right arrow = move selection box east
trace       = move selection box down
graph       = move selection box up

2nd         = place block
del         = remove block
zoom        = right click block (only used for chests right now)


character movement (currently disabled)
---------------------------------------

1 = move character south
7 = move character west
9 = move character north
3 = move character east
4 = move character down (if block clipping is off)
6 = move character up (if block clipping is off)


map rotation
------------
- (minus)  = rotate map clockwise 90 degrees
+ (plus)   = rotate map counter-clockwise 90 degrees


map positioning
---------------
alpha        = move map left
stat         = move map right
mode         = move map up
X,T,theta,n  = move map down


world time / map brightness
---------------------------
ln           = fade to day
sto->        = fade to night
/ (divide)   = decrease world brightness
* (multiply) = increase world brightness


other
-----
enter = exit program
