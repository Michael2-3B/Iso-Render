# Iso-Render

Rendering beautiful isometric terrain, using sprites, in C on the TI-84+ CE.

This program is currently in progress, its mostly an experiment, but might be a game soon.

Player positioning/movement is a bit borked right now, so I've disabled the player for the time being.

However I just added map editing and am working on that currently

Latest update: Falling blocks! Sand and gravel now are affected by gravity:
