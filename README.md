# Isometric-Minecraft-CE 
## An isometric sandbox game for the TI 84+ CE. Coded in C.

NOTE (As of August 29 2023):
If you are trying to run the program, make sure you send the .8xp file to the calculators Archive, NOT the RAM. It will not run from the RAM.
If it still does not run, make sure you move all your important files to the archive, and then perform a RAM clear.
Note that the latest working version does not contain redstone. The program also does not currently feature any world saving abilities.
And lastly, note that animated blocks like fire may lag the game significantly, and you will have to restart the game.

### Current Features (newest additions first):
* Gradual daytime/nighttime (currently manual, but will be automatic)  
* Brightness setting  
* Animated blocks (fire, chests)  
* Dynamic block/sky lighting (adapts to world, so light does not pass through blocks)  
* Shadows (goes along with the lighting effects)  
* Map Rotation  
* Block gravity/physics (for sand and gravel)  
* Placing and breaking blocks  
* Player and player movement (currently disabled, and a bit buggy)  
* Dynamic, random terrain  

The program is currently in progress, so bugs are to be expected, and many features are not fully or properly implemented yet.
