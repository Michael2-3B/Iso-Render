# Iso-Render

Rendering beautiful isometric terrain, using sprites, in C on the TI-84+ CE.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Player positioning is a bit borked right now
However you can still move using the numpad buttons 1, 7, 9, and 3 in order to go in those directions on the map

This program is currently in progress, its mostly an experiment, but might be a game soon
