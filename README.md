# Isometric-Minecraft-CE 
## An isometric sandbox game for the TI 84+ CE. Coded in C.

### Current Features (newest additions first):
* Gradual daytime/nighttime (currently manual, but will be automatic)  
* Brightness setting  
* Animated blocks (fire, chests)  
* Dynamic block/sky lighting (adapts to world, so light does not pass through blocks)  
* Shadows (goes along with the lighting effects)  
* Map Rotation  
* Block gravity/physics (for sand and gravel)  
* Placing and breaking blocks  
* Player and player movement (currently disabled, and a bit buggy)  
* Dynamic, random terrain  

The program is currently in progress, so bugs are to be expected, and many features are not fully or properly implemented yet.
