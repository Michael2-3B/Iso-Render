# Iso-Render  
## Basically, minecraft but isometric. Coded in C for the TI 84+ CE.  

### Current Features (newest additions first):
* Torch lighting (and night time)  
* Shadows  
* Map Rotation  
* Block gravity/physics (for sand and gravel)  
* Placing and breaking blocks  
* Player and player movement (currently disabled, and a bit buggy)  
* Dynamic, random terrain  

The program is currently in progress, so bugs are to be expected, and many features are not fully or properly implemented yet.  

**LATEST UPDATE:** Torch lighting and shadows!
